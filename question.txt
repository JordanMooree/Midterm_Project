Comparing before using CSS and after using CSS, have your web pages improved or not? If so, why? If not, why not?

(Jordan) - Before using CSS, my HTML file (jordan.html) was plain and not exciting. It had no complimenting color, typography, or alignment with any of the  HTML elements. After adding CSS, the page came to life and showed improvement from HTML. The color, typography, and layout of the page improved via the control of CSS. I used the flexbox model in many areas on my page and applied them to the main page (index.html).
(Lacurtis)- The inclusion of CSS on my webpage significantly improved the look and feel of the webpage. Rather than everything looking basic, and not visually appealing in general, CSS allowed me to implement differen colors, arrange the content in different ways, and transform the webpage into something that is appealing for users to look at. Additionally, the use of CSS on the main page allows us to establish a theme for the rest of the pages inlcuded in our website.
