Check out this for logos: https://www.canva.com/search/templates?q=gaming%20logo
I can modify they text on those logos, just let me know which ones you like

main.css is used for the index, jordan.css is for my page, and
yours is curtis.css for your page. I don't mind just leaving all the css
under one css file so if you think that'll be better just let me know!
